### Hi there 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

Hello, I'm Chris. I'm an aspiring software engineer working through the Full Stack Web Development program at BloomTech (the Bloom Institute of Technology.) I'm currently learning React and looking forward to learning more about building REST APIs.

I've spent more than a decade working in various customer-facing roles, and I hope to bring a focus on the customer experience to the software I help develop.

Things I'm passionate about:
- 🧠 Simplifying the complex.
- 🛜 Software with great REST APIs.
- 🤖 Automating as much as possible.
- ✅ Customer-driven feature development.
- 🔐 Secure code and least-privilege-focused security principles.
