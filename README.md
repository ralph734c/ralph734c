### Hi there 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

My name is Chris. I'm an aspiring software engineer working through the Full Stack Web Development program at BloomTech (the Bloom Institute of Technology) and am nearing completion. I love working with back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, SQL, and secure authentication via tools such as Clerk, Supabase, Firebase, etc.

I enjoy working for startups and, for some reason, love writing documentation. I've spent 14+ years in various customer-facing roles and have worked in technical customer-facing roles for the last seven years (Technical Support, Support Engineering, and Technical Success). I want to focus on a smooth customer experience in the software I help develop.

Things I'm passionate about:
- 🧠 Simplifying the complex.
- 🛜 Software with great REST APIs.
- 🤖 Automating as much as possible.
- ✅ Customer-driven feature development.
- 🔐 Secure code and least-privilege-focused security principles.
