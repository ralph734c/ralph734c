### Hi there 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

Hello, I'm Chris. I'm an aspiring software engineer working through the Full Stack Web Development program at BloomTech (the Bloom Institute of Technology.) I'm learning back-end technologies I love, such as Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, and SQL.

I enjoy working for startups and, for some reason, love writing documentation. I've spent more than a decade working in various customer-facing roles, and I want to bring a focus on the customer experience to the software I help develop.

Things I'm passionate about:
- 🧠 Simplifying the complex.
- 🛜 Software with great REST APIs.
- 🤖 Automating as much as possible.
- ✅ Customer-driven feature development.
- 🔐 Secure code and least-privilege-focused security principles.
